title: Categorical Bin

image: /assets/img/interface-documentation/categorical-bin/catbin-example.png
type: Name interpreter
creates: Categorical attributes
uses_prompts: Yes
good:
  - Use this Interface to collect nominal data on alters. Although a Toggle Button Group can be added as an [input control](/en/desktop/key-concepts/input-controls) on other interfaces, the drag and drop functionality on the Categorical Bin provides a tactile method to capturing these data that is engaging for participants.
bad:
  - Avoid using more than eight categories on this Interface. More categories cause the category labels to be difficult to read and the other visual compromises on the Interface become compromised.
  - Avoid using the Categorical Bin to capture dichotomous variables. Dichotomous variables are best captured using the Toggle [input control](/en/desktop/key-concepts/input-controls) (on a [Name Generator](/en/desktop/interface-documentation/name-generator-using-forms) or [Per Alter Form](/en/desktop/interface-documentation/per-alter-form)) or using the variable toggling feature on the [Sociogram](/en/desktop/interface-documentation/sociogram).

The Categorical Bin is a name interpreter Interface that collects nominal data on the alters in a participant's network. When using the Categorical Bin, participants drag and drop alters one-by-one into colorful circles which each represent a category of the categorical variable. Once placed, participants can tap on any category and move alters within that category to any other.

## Configuring Categorical Bin

A Categorical Bin screen can include multiple [prompts](/en/desktop/key-concepts/prompts), each of which relates to a single [categorical variable](/en/desktop/reference/variable-types#categorical).

Additionally an _other_ variable can be specified for custom responses that don't fit into the pre-configured categories.
