title: Sociogram

type: Name Interpreter and Edge Generator
creates: Edges of multiple types, and attribute data on a single node type
uses_prompts: Yes
bad:
  - Nodes positioned too close together may visually occlude one another or the edge between them. Caution participants not to place nodes directly on top of one another.
good:
  - Consider customizing the background image of the sociogram to orient participants to the activity or to add meaning to the layout variable (e.g. such as using quadrants).
  - Ensure that the prompts used on this Interface are edge creation prompts - questions about the relationships between alters.

Sociograms are the visual mapping component of a network interview. On the Sociogram, participants draw ties between alters to signify the relationships between individuals within their personal network.

There are two sociogram Interfaces in Network Canvas - one for data collection and one for data display - that can be added to your study and configured in Architect.

## Sociogram

When using the "Sociogram" Interface, participants position their alters and draw ties between them. The Interface can be used to create one or multiple edge types between alters in a participant's network, and to collect alter attribute data by highlighting alters where the variable value is true.
