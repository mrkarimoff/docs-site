title: Per Alter Edge Form

image: /assets/img/interface-documentation/per-edge-form/example.png
type: Edge Interpreter
creates: Attribute data on a single edge type
uses_prompts: No
bad:
  - Avoid overloading this Interface with too many fields and/or text-heavy prompts.
  - Do not use this Interface in place of a dyad census as participants will only be asked to provide data on existing edges between alters rather than all possible alter combinations. If your study requires a [Dyad Census](/en/desktop/interface-documentation/dyad-census) you can add and configure that Interface in Architect.
good:
  - Use this Interface as a simple way to systematically collect data on edges.
  - Use the introductory panel to orient participants to the tasks within the form they will complete for each edge.
  - Consider including form fields to capture temporal data which utilize [input controls](/en/desktop/key-concepts/input-controls) like the [DatePicker](/en/desktop/key-concepts/input-controls/#date-picker).

The Per Alter Edge Form is an _edge interpreter_ interface that collects attribute data on the edges, or relationships, between nodes in a participant's network. When using the Per Alter Edge Form, participants review an introductory screen that describes the tasks on the stage and then complete a [form](/en/desktop/key-concepts/forms) for each edge they previously defined between pairs of alters within their network. These forms are customizable and can include one or multiple fields to collect specific edge attribute data.

## Configuring Per Alter Edge Form

A single edge type is selectable per screen. This screen supports [filtering](/en/desktop/key-concepts/network-filtering) for edges that match the
specified type.

The introduction screen is shown before any matching edges and can be used to introduce the task.

Each edge will be assigned [variables](/en/desktop/reference/variable-types) using a configurable [form](/en/desktop/key-concepts/forms).
