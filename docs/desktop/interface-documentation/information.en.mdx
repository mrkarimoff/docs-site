The Information Interface is a general purpose screen that can be used to present information to participants using a variety of text and media resources. For example, this screen can be useful to introduce a study or to provide instructions or context for a particular stage in the survey.

When using the Information Interface, you can incorporate one or multiple [resources](/en/desktop/key-concepts/resources) by either retrieving files from your resource library in Architect or locally from your device. No more than four items can be used at one time.

## Configuring Information Screen

An information screen is made up of a column of 4 spaces for content. These can be text, images, videos and audio. Items can be re-arranged by dragging. Items can be resized to take up 1, 2 or 4 of the available spaces by dragging from the bottom right corner of the item.
