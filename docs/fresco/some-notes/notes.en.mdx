**TipBox example** (can be alternative to `{:.tip-box}` and `{: .tip-box .caution}`)

<TipBox>
  Welcome to Fresco! You can use it as a starting point for your own project :)
</TipBox>

**StandAlone example** (can be alternative to `{:standalone}`)

<StandAloneImage
  src="/assets/img/case-id.png"
  content="Some text about the image"
/>

**KeyConcept example** (can be alternative to `{: .key-concept data-title="Roster size constraints"}`)

<KeyConcept title="Roster size constraints">
  We have tested a 60,000 node roster with success, however, rosters of this
  size are not without problems. If your study requires such a roster, please be
  prepared for the loading and search functions to slow down considerably. The
  upper limit of this interface is largely dependent on both the device you use
  and your usability threshold, so a powerful laptop might be required
  particularly for larger datasets. For information on devices, please see our
  article on [choosing a device for your
  study](/en/desktop/how-to/choosing-hardware)
</KeyConcept>

**ImageFullWith example** (can be alternative to `{: .img-width-full}`)

<ImageFullWith
  src="/assets/img/server-guide/discovery-section.png"
  name="discovery-section"
/>

**ImageFloatLeft example** (can be alternative to `{: .img-float-left .img-width-20}`)

<ImageFloatLeft
  name="screen-shot-2021-04-29-at-5.03.54-pm.png"
  src="/assets/uploads/screen-shot-2021-04-29-at-5.03.54-pm.png"
/>

Your workspaces are shown in the purple column on the left hand side of the app,
with a large plus button always visible that can be used to create a new workspace.

To create a new workspace, locate a `.netcanvas` protocol file. For the purposes of this demonstration, we can use the sample protocol file that has been discussed in the tutorials on Interviewer and Architect (which can be downloaded [here](https://github.com/complexdatacollective/Documentation/blob/master/protocols/Sample%20Protocol%20v2.netcanvas)).

Once imported, you will see a workspace icon that contains the initials of the protocol name, with a unique background that is generated based on the protocol content. Clicking this icon will switch to that workspace, and show the "overview" tab.

**Citation example** (I handled the `{:.citation}` with tailwind css `prose-blockquote:border-blue-500`)

> Complex Data Collective. Network Canvas Interviewer. 2016. www.doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.6026548

**Main Header example** (I handled the `{: .fs-9 }` with a custom class in global.css `mainHeading` )

**Button examples** (can be alternative to `{: .btn .btn-primary .fs-5 .mb-4 .mb-md-0 .mr-2 }`)

<ButtonPrimary href="#">Project Overview</ButtonPrimary>

<ButtonSecondary href="#">Installation Guide</ButtonSecondary>
